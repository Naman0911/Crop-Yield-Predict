# Crop Yield Predict

This repository contains a **Crop Yield Prediction** project developed by **Naman Upadhyay**.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to predict crop yield using historical agricultural data such as pesticide usage and yield statistics. A machine learning model has been trained and evaluated to provide accurate yield predictions.

## Model Performance

- **Accuracy:** **98.7%**
- The model demonstrates high predictive performance on the evaluation dataset.

## Repository Contents

- `crop.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, analysis, model training, and evaluation  
- `Crop_Yield_Prediction.pkl` – Trained machine learning model  
- `pesticides.csv` – Dataset related to pesticide usage  
- `yield_df.csv` – Crop yield dataset  

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- pandas  
- numpy  
- scikit-learn  
- matplotlib / seaborn (for visualization)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Naman0911/Crop-Yield-Predict.git
   cd Crop-Yield-Predict
   ```

2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```

3. Open and run the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook crop.ipynb
   ```

## Results

The trained model achieves an **accuracy of 98.7%**, indicating strong predictive capability for crop yield estimation.
